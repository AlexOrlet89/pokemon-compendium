# Compendium Planning

- Get my list of pokemon showing up on the page
  1. write your fetch function -- validate with console.log //check
  1. add UseEffect and set state with the response
  1. map through your state and display the name
  1. build out your PokeCard component -- use static values
  1. map through your items and display PokeCard
- Build out types dropdown
  1. getTypes from the API
  1. call getTypes and set in state
  1. make state for selected dropdown
  1. make a dropdown with the types and selected dropdown
  1. add useEffect to call API when the dropdown changes

## General Flow

1. make a state variable
1. make UX to allow user to change that state variable
1. add state variable to useEffect dependency array so API is refreshed when state changes
